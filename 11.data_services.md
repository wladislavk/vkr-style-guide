Data services
=============

A data service is a class that is mostly used to keep some data. Data
services are not unit-testable and MUST NOT contain business logic.
Model classes in the MVC architecture are a case of data services,
however a model is intended to be persistent, while a non-model data
service is volatile.

Models SHOULD be named as singular versions of respective DB tables.

Data services MUST be located in namespaces that are separate from plain
services and controllers. Data services SHOULD NOT be injected as
constructor dependencies, all instances of a data service SHOULD be
created via `new` keyword. Therefore, data services SHOULD NOT be mocked
in a unit test.

Every field of a data service MUST have its own docblock, MUST be
type-safe (not counting nulls) and should be initialized with a default
value. If a field of a data service is a collection, it SHOULD have all
elements of the same type.

There MAY exist a hierarchy of data services should the need arise.

## Transforming non-enumerated collections

A non-enumerated collection is a composite type of data that allows to
refer to its elements using arbitrary keys and does not implement
whitelist approach to these keys. Examples of non-enumerated collections
include PHP associative arrays, Javascript object literals, Python
dictionaries, "standard class" objects etc.

Non-enumerated collections SHOULD NOT be used except in following cases:
1) as a class constant, since in some languages enumerated objects
cannot be marked constants;
2) if a framework or a third-party library accepts it as an argument;
3) if a framework or a third-party library returns it on call to one
of its methods.

In all other cases, data services SHOULD be used.

In the latter two cases, it is RECOMMENDED to create a data service
with public transformer methods that transform it into a
non-enumerated collection or transform the collection back into the
service object and call these methods immediately before passing the
collection to a third-party method, or immediately after retrieving
the collection from such method. Whenever these transformer methods
require logic, they SHOULD be moved to separate non-data service
classes.

## Getters and setters

Sometimes, a common operation needs to be performed on an element before
it is added to a data service. Also, using methods rather than public
properties gives more convenient syntax to the caller and provides
methods to better ensure type-safety. Therefore, getters and setters MAY
be added to a data service.

Once a field contains a getter, it MUST contain a setter, and vice
versa. Once a field contains a getter and a setter, it MUST be declared
private or protected.

Setters SHOULD return `this` pointer, as it allows chaining of setters.
