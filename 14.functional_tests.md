Functional tests
================

Functional tests are to be understood as a replacement of unit tests for
controllers. Unlike unit tests, they do not contain mocks and run on a
real database. Functional tests SHOULD use testing mechanisms provided
by the framework.

Functional tests SHOULD test the following:
- application response code
- application response payload
- changes to external data sources, e.g. database or filesystem
- actions that cannot be tested otherwise, such as sending emails.

The guidelines for determining the number of test methods for a unit
test apply to functional tests as well: each controller conditional with
early return MUST be tested.

If middleware is used, it MUST be tested as well, middleware MAY be
tested on a very simple controller or a special dummy controller.

If a third-party API is called, and this API does not provide any test
credentials, a bridge SHOULD be created together with a dummy
implementation that conforms to the API documentation.

Sometimes a condition cannot be tested functionally. For example, a
third-party service throws an exception that needs to be caught and
an error response provided, however the real-life application can
never throw that exception. In this case, a runtime exception
SHOULD be re-thrown in place of error response.

To perform functional tests, a test database MUST be created and
populated. It is not recommended to re-create the database on each test
run, as this will impact the performance of tests. Coders MUST ensure
that every change to the database that happens during a functional
test is fixed immediately afterwards. In other words, test behavior
MUST NOT depend on the order of execution of test classes or test
methods.

In xUnit architecture, the clean-up code MUST be located in the
teardown method, rather than the setup method, test methods or the class
destructor.
