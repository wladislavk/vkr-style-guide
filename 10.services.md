Services
========

All development SHOULD be service-oriented which means that services
SHOULD contain all or nearly all of the application's business logic.

All of the following concerns *plain services* that are to be
distinguished from *data services*, that are described in the following
chapter.

Outside unit tests, services MUST be initialized within a special
class that is called *service container*. These containers are usually
provided by frameworks. Any other class MUST inject services, not
initialize them.

## Isolation

A service MUST be either a "plain old" class (not extending anything),
or a part of a simple hierarchy. A service MUST NOT extend a framework
class and SHOULD NOT extend a library class. A service SHOULD NOT inject
any framework dependency. In case a class from the framework is needed,
it is RECOMMENDED to import the part of the framework that contains
that class as a separate library via the package manager.

All objects of the request-response cycle are considered to be parts of
the framework, so manipulation with these objects MUST happen inside
controllers.

## Statelessness

A service MUST be stateless which means that it MUST NOT keep anything
on its properties, except for the data defined in constructor that does
not change during the application's lifetime. Statelessness prevents
temporal coupling (public methods may be called in any order) and
ensures that a service works in the same way whether it is marked as a
singleton or not. In other words, we MUST handle each service as if it
were a singleton, even if it is not.

## Public methods

A service SHOULD have a single public method. This ensures that the
service follows the Single Responsibility Principle and is easy enough
to test. The name of the public method SHOULD correspond with the name
of the service, but it SHOULD be a verb phrase, e.g. a service named
`ConditionRetriever` SHOULD have a public method named
`retrieveConditions`. The service MUST NOT have more than three public
methods and MUST NOT have any setter methods to keep stateless.

Public methods SHOULD NOT be called in protected or private context,
as doing so indicates that a class should be extracted.

## Few dependencies

A service MUST NOT have more than five dependencies on other objects,
and SHOULD NOT have more than three dependencies on other objects to
follow the Single Responsibility Principle and be easily testable.
A service MAY have additional non-object dependencies such as global
config parameters.

## Simple constructor

Constructors and all their private callees SHOULD stay simple and
logic-less to provide easier testing.

## Service constants

A service MUST NOT define any public constants. If a constant is used
by more than one class / hierarchy, it MAY be placed either into a
controller or a data service or a separate interface.

## Service hierarchies

Polymorphic hierarchies SHOULD be used to prevent code duplication and
provide cleaner and easy-to-test code. A hierarchy SHOULD be created
when:
1) there is some code duplication among different methods of a service;
2) there are similarly-named methods calling a single method from the
same service or another service.

Every hierarchy MUST have an abstract class at its top. All hierarchy
members, including abstract classes, MUST reside under a common
namespace that is dedicated exclusively to the members of this
hierarchy.

Every abstract class MUST have at least one non-abstract public
method, if only a constructor. Abstract public methods SHOULD NOT be
used, as they point to violations of the hierarchy-wide Single
Responsibility Principle. All abstract methods SHOULD be defined as
protected. For the same reason it is NOT RECOMMENDED to define public
methods in non-abstract hierarchy members.

Unless the application is intended for re-use, hierarchies SHOULD NOT be
created 'just in case'. If there is just one implementation in the
present, it should be refactored into a hierarchy as soon as the second
implementation appears, but not earlier.

## Factories

A factory is a class that returns objects of other classes. Every
hierarchy needs a factory. A factory SHOULD be created in one of two
cases:
1) a case of polymorphism where an abstract method of a certain
hierarchy needs to be called and the implementation is chosen based on
some condition;
2) all implementations of a particular hierarchy need to be used in a
sequence.

Factories MAY reside in a namespace of their own or use the hierarchy
namespace. Certain operators such as `switch`, `elseif` and `instanceof`
MAY be used in factories but SHOULD NOT be used in other non-template
code.

## Database access services

Database access services, also known as repository classes, are plain
services that communicate with ORM by forming database queries and
executing them. Unlike regular services, database access services
contain big number of calls to ORM methods that are hard to mock, they
also tend to contain hidden conditions in form of complex queries.

Database access services SHOULD be moved into a separate namespace
and SHOULD NOT be unit-tested. They MUST NOT contain conditionals;
any conditions MUST be moved to their callers. The purpose of database
access services is mostly to call ORM methods, however in some
situations ORM methods, especially those that do not deal with
building database queries, MAY be placed in regular services.

Database access services SHOULD be treated as regular services in other
ways, e.g. they MUST be injected, not initialized, and SHOULD be
understood as singletons.
