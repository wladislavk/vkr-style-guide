Templates
=========

Templates are pieces of code that are intended to be displayed to the
user in any form. Templates are usually written in a domain-specific
language, but even if this is not the case, they are to be treated as
a separate entity that SHOULD be decoupled from the rest of the code as
much as possible.

This guide does not concern itself with templates, because template
coding uses different sets of rules.

Templates MAY contain logic, however their logic is different from the
main application logic. Templates MUST NOT contain any logic that is
either too complex or is not directly related to the presentation. If
the form of presentation is determined based on a complex condition,
this condition SHOULD be evaluated and saved into a boolean variable
before being passed to the template.

All language strings that are directly shown to the user SHOULD be
understood as parts of template logic and SHOULD NOT be referred to
outside of templates to provide easier i18n. The exception from this
rule is generic exception messages that MAY be passed straight to the
user in case of runtime exception.
