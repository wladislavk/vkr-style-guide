Exceptions
==========

All errors MUST be handled using the language exception mechanism.

Custom code SHOULD NOT throw pre-defined language or framework
exceptions, create custom exception sub-types instead. If a custom
non-controller code expects a non-custom exception and then wants to
re-throw it, it still SHOULD use a custom exception, not the one that
was caught.

The majority of exception-handling code SHOULD lie in the controller or
in a special service created just for that purpose. The
exception-handling code SHOULD differentiate between custom and generic
exceptions.

All exceptions that are mentioned in docblock annotations MUST be caught
somewhere in the code, presumably in the controller, except for runtime
exceptions, that MUST NOT be caught and are intended to display generic
errors to the client. If a coder wants to throw an uncatchable-by-design
exception, they MUST do it by creating a custom runtime exception class.

`try` operators MUST extend over as few lines of code as possible.
Ideally `try` operators SHOULD NOT extend over more than one line.
