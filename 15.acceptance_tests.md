Acceptance tests
================

Acceptance testing solves three problems:
1) eases up communication between development team and company
management by clearly showing which features are implemented and in what
way;
2) allows to test borderline interactions that are hard to test
otherwise, such as Ajax calls;
3) allows to test poorly written code that is hard to test otherwise.

New acceptance tests MUST be created for every new feature, with the
following exceptions:
1) the feature is completely technical and does not change user
experience, i.e. moving some data to a new DB table or a change in
algorithm for generation of reports;
2) the feature changes user experience in a way that depends on
subjective human perception, such as: CSS changes, animation, HTML
changes for "tidying up" look and feel of a webpage etc.;
3) the feature changes user experience in a way that is hard to test
because of technical limitations, such as parsing of `window` object by
headless browsers.

New acceptance tests MUST be created for any large-scale migrations of
the code, even if they do not lead to changes in user experience.

There are several approaches to acceptance testing, and this guide does
not specify which one to use. However, there are important points that
are to be observed no matter which approach and technology is used.

Acceptance tests MUST be written in a way that allows them to be
executed on any host. Acceptance tests MUST NOT rely on any data that
is considered private to the application.

## Feature specifications

Feature specifications SHOULD be understood as a separate entity from
the tests themselves. Feature specifications MUST be as simple and
readable as possible, MUST boil down to a simple sequence of commands
and MUST NOT contain conditionals.

Feature specifications MUST NOT be technical, meaning that they cannot
include anything that is not easily understandable to an average end
user. For this reason, database changes and specifics of network
protocol messages MUST NOT be tested directly, the only thing that may
be tested is the impact these changes have on user experience.

## External resources and networks

In case if acceptance tests modify the database, they MUST restore it
to the previous state in the same way as functional tests. In some
cases, it MAY lead to creating new controllers used exclusively for
acceptance testing.

If network protocols are used, it is RECOMMENDED for acceptance tests
to send a custom header with every request so that the main application
understands that the request came from acceptance tests. It is needed
to provide security and mocking, when appropriate.

## Third-party APIs

Work with third-party APIs SHOULD be treated as follows: failures in a
third-party API MUST NOT impact tests, as the test scope is isolated to
the application itself. However, a mechanism MAY be created that would
allow to run tests against the real API, should the need arise.

## What to test and what not to test

Unlike unit tests and functional tests, acceptance tests do not conform
to any strict standard regarding the scope of testing. The general rule
is: test for the things that are perceived to be important.

In general, only the "good" user stories are tested. It means that paths
of user interaction that are expected to result in failures, stay
outside of test scope. "Bad" stories SHOULD be tested in parts of the
application that relate to security (authentication and authorization)
or are known to be prone to bugs.
