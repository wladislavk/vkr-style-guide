Database manipulation
=====================

This style guide does not deal with the database architecture; however,
certain rules are used whenever working with persistent storage, no
matter what type of database is being used.

One model class per table SHOULD be created. One database access
service class per table SHOULD be created, given that any custom code
is needed to deal with this table.

Custom repositories and pieces of logic on the database side, such as
SQL views, functions and stored procedures SHOULD NOT be used, unless
proven that their use leads to performance gain, as they decrease
readability and testability of the code.

Queries SHOULD be as simple as possible unless proven that complex query
will give notable performance gain. Dividing long queries is beneficial
both for testability and readability, and sometimes even gives better
performance.

Queries SHOULD NOT contain operations that can be labelled as 'logical'
because this logic is much easier to test if it is contained in
programming code and perhaps it would perform better in code too. This
applies to conditionals, string manipulation and type casting.

In general, SQL functions SHOULD NOT be used, except for:
- basic aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT` and `AVG`
- datetime functions.

SQL `LIKE` operator is always a performance hit and it SHOULD be avoided
if possible.

Raw SQL SHOULD NOT be used in general, because it bypasses any safety
mechanisms and abstraction layers that ORMs provide. Besides, ORMs tend
to give better performance. If raw SQL cannot be avoided for some
reason, ANSI-compatible syntax SHOULD be preferred.
