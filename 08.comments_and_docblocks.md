Comments and docblocks
======================

## Comments

Comments SHOULD be used sparingly. Good code documents itself, and is
also documented by tests, therefore comments SHOULD NOT be the primary
means of providing low-level documentation. The primary usage of
comments is for:

- documenting non-evident lines of code
- documenting the code that is required to override quirks or bugs found
in the framework or in third-party libraries
- TODO comments that outline incomplete or quirky code that will be
fixed in the future.

A name is always better than a comment, so in case when the code cannot
be made readable (e.g. regular expressions), it is RECOMMENDED to wrap
it into a one-line private method.

Commented out code MUST NOT be committed under any circumstances.

## Docblocks

Docblocks MUST be present for every class method except methods that
neither take arguments nor return a value. Also, docblocks MUST be
present for every class property.

There are certain methods, that can return any subtype of a given
supertype, but only one type per call, for example a method that
receives class name as an argument and returns an object of that class.
If this is the case, every call to such method inside a method body MUST
contain its own docblock line, e.g.
```
/** Foo|null $foo */
$foo = Foo::find($id);
```

All docblocks MUST contain all possible types of properties,
arguments and return values. If an argument, property or return value is
an array, docblocks SHOULD specify its element types, such as
`string[]`, rather than just `array`. Special type `mixed` SHOULD NOT be
used, except for generics. If a type is nullable, use `type|null`
format.

`throws` annotations MUST be used on a method, if:
1) the method throws an exception and it is uncaught in the same method,
or
2) one of the method's callees throws an exception and it is uncaught
neither in the callee nor in the method, which applies to callees in
vendor packages as well, but
3) if an exception is a runtime exception, the method MUST NOT use
`throws` annotation.
