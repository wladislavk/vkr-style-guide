Controllers
===========

The word "controller" here should not be understood exclusively in terms
of the MVC pattern. Any kind of code that acts as an entry point to the
application as a whole or one of its parts and deals with external input
and output, is a "controller", as far as this document is concerned.
Common examples of controllers include middleware classes, console
commands and frontend components.

Controllers SHOULD be skinny, which means 'as short as possible'.
A controller normally MUST NOT have conditional logic, with the
exception of a simple conditional that results in immediate early
return, such as
```
try {
    $myService->doSomething();
} catch (MyException $e) {
    return ApiResponse::error($e->getMessage());
}
```

Controllers SHOULD NOT contain loops.

Controllers MUST NOT contain private or protected methods. All public
methods MUST be called only from a source that is external to the
application code, e.g. from the framework or straight from the OS.

Controllers MAY use private or protected properties populated by a
dependency injection mechanism.

Since controllers are not unit-testable, they MAY contain static calls
or unwrapped filesystem calls.
