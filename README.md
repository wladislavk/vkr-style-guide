About
=====

The VKR style guide was first created by me in 2016, based on a few
books on programming theory and personal aesthetics. It was used for
several different software projects in PHP and JS/TS. It lived through
several rewrites and may still be considered work in progress. I decided
to publish it as a separate open-source repo mostly for my own purposes,
but anyone who wants to use it or propose any additions to it, is
welcome to do so.
