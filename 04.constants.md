Constants
=========

All "magical" strings and numbers MUST be wrapped into constants.

All constants MUST be wrapped inside classes or interfaces.

String literals SHOULD be wrapped into constants with following
exceptions: date and time strings, database queries and string literals
that are commonly used by standard library functions. Empty strings
SHOULD NOT be wrapped. There SHOULD NOT be more than 10 string literals
per class, not counting empty strings, outside test code.

Numbers SHOULD be wrapped into constants, unless their meaning is
obvious: e.g. 365 in the context of dates, 0 as an initial value of an
integer variable etc.

Constants MAY be placed into any class that uses them, or, if they have
application-wide use and can be easily grouped, a constant interface MAY
be created.

However, having too many constant collections that get re-used often is
a potential problem that MAY indicate the need to move them into
database.
