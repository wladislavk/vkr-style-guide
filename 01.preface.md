Preface
=======

This style guide was created with the purpose of unification of coding
style across members of development teams that deal with low-concurrency
single-threaded application software. This guide is highly opinionated
and is not intended to cover all possible coding methods and patterns.

The initial version of this guide was written specifically for PHP,
however it may be used for any object-oriented language with mandatory
or optional static typing, e.g. Java or TypeScript. It can also be used
for languages with dynamic typing, e.g. Javascript or Python, albeit
with a few changes. All examples are in PHP, unless otherwise stated.

Most patterns set in this guide may be used with other types of
software, e.g. high-concurrency frontend frameworks that support
service-oriented architecture. It is assumed by default that the code is
not intended for re-use, some patterns may differ for reusable code.

This guide aims to set logical patterns rather than language-specific
details, so it purposefully omits editing technicalities such as
indentation, placement of whitespaces or newline characters. Developers
are encouraged to use whatever editing standard is considered the most
popular in the ecosystem of the language they use.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
