Classes and methods
===================

Every file that does not produce output and does not contain a template
MUST have one and only one class or interface.

Classes MUST be namespaced.

A class MUST NOT be longer than 300 lines in total. A class SHOULD NOT
be longer than 200 lines in total. Exceptions: data services with lots
of properties and no logic, and classes with extensive annotations.

## Static classes

If a class has at least one static method, all other methods MUST be
static in order to evade confusion.

Generally, static classes SHOULD NOT be created, but there are some
notable exceptions when a static class creates more terse syntax for
very common operations.

A static class MUST NOT contain any logic and MUST reside in a dedicated
namespace. Static classes cannot be properly unit-tested, so they SHOULD
have a corresponding non-static service that would contain all of the
class's logic.

## Final classes

In general, it SHOULD be assumed that every non-abstract class is final.
However, `final` keyword is dangerous. It MAY be used in controllers,
static classes and data services. A regular service MUST NOT use `final`
unless it is guaranteed that it never gets injected into another
service, and is only required from controllers. Otherwise, it will be
hard to mock it in a unit test.

## Interfaces and traits

Interfaces are of little use in application code that is not intended
for re-use. The need for interface may mean one of the two things:
1) we have a highly decoupled module that can be moved to a library of
its own,
2) we are trying to implement a hierarchy but we are doing it the wrong
way so our topmost class does not have a public implementation.

Interfaces SHOULD NOT be used outside of reusable code, but there is one
exception: immutable collections of contexts SHOULD be declared
interfaces for clarity.

A trait is a collection of method that can be inserted into a class.
Traits, as interfaces, SHOULD NOT be used in non-reusable code. If a
trait is created for whatever reason, it MUST have a corresponding
interface to provide the possibility of type-hinting.

## Methods

A method MUST NOT be longer than 50 lines, excluding docblock. A method
SHOULD NOT be longer than 30 lines, excluding docblock.

## Type safety

If the language provides the possibility to type-hint, type hinting
SHOULD be used whenever possible. All arguments and all return types,
including `void`, SHOULD be type-hinted. Docblocks SHOULD NOT be
understood as a replacement for type hints.

There are several exceptions to this rule. `null` MAY be used with any
argument type or return type, most languages provide null-optional
type hints.

It is RECOMMENDED to use special prefix `T` for method names and
argument names in case if either argument type or return type is
generic by design. Generic arguments and methods provide replacement
for overloading in languages that do not support it.

In the absence of both the type hint and the `T` prefix it is assumed
that the coder forgot the type hint. However, lack of type hint MAY
happen by necessity if the method overrides a method of parent class
from the framework or from a third-party library.

Collection type safety SHOULD be provided. A collection is type-safe
if all its elements have the same type. In case of collections,
elements of type `null` SHOULD NOT be used.

## Boolean arguments

Boolean arguments SHOULD NOT be used. Methods with boolean arguments
SHOULD be refactored in one of the following ways: move the condition
to the caller, or create an additional method.

## Boolean returns

If a method returns a boolean, it SHOULD be named as a yes/no question,
for example, prefixes `is` or `has` MAY be used. Booleans MUST NOT be
used as a replacement for exception handling, nor is boolean `false` a
replacement for `null`.
