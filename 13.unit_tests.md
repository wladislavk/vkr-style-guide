Unit tests
==========

A unit test is a test that is completely isolated from its environment.
All classes that contain business logic MUST be unit-tested. Classes
that are eligible for unit-testing MUST reside in separate namespaces.
Unit tests for these classes MUST be located either in the same
directory as their SUT classes, or at the same path and namespace
relative to tests root as where SUT classes are relative to production
code root.

Testable classes MUST include all plain services and SHOULD NOT include
controllers, wrappers, test cases, and data services.

The general rule regarding the tests is that all conditionals MUST be
unit-tested with a notable exception of controller conditionals that
return response immediately. Therefore, non-unit-testable classes SHOULD
NOT contain any other conditionals.

All examples below assume that xUnit architecture is used.

## Number of test methods

The number of test methods per each test class can be calculated
precisely based on these rules:

1) one test method MUST call a public SUT method one time only;
2) each conditional outside loop MUST have its own test method;
3) conditionals inside loop MAY be tested in a single method by creating
collection elements with different properties;
4) however, conditionals with `return` operators in their bodies MUST
have their own test methods even if inside loops;
5) each exception thrown MUST have its own test method, both inside
and outside loops;
6) if a conditional contains several conditions, it SHOULD be treated as
if there are several conditionals, so `if (a && b)` is the same as
`if (a) { if (b) {}}`;
7) every public method MUST be tested, even if it doesn't have
conditionals;
8) hidden conditionals SHOULD be covered by tests, e.g. `|` operator
in regular expressions.

## Number of assertions

Any test method MAY have any number of assertions.

Tests MUST assert that:
1) A certain value is returned, if any;
2) A certain exception is thrown, if any, including both its type and
its message.

Tests SHOULD assert that:
1) a public method of another class is called with certain arguments;
2) if a collection is returned, all its fields have certain data.

Collections MAY be asserted using a single assertion or one assertion
per element.

Standard library functions and framework helper functions SHOULD be
trusted, there is no need to test their results.

## Testing hierarchies

Three approaches MAY be used when testing hierarchies.

1) Mock the abstract class while keeping all its methods, then test it
separately from its children.
2) In case if one child is very small, test abstract class conditions
inside that child.
3) In case if all classes are small, test all hierarchy classes inside
the same test class.

## Mockable and non-mockable classes

A unit test MUST mock its mockable dependencies and SHOULD NOT mock its
non-mockable dependencies. A mockable dependency is any class that
cannot be perceived as a simple collection of elements. Therefore,
data services SHOULD NOT be mocked.

## Test wrappers

Some plain functions from standard lib or frameworks try to connect to
an external resource, e.g. filesystem or HTTP request headers. Also,
some third-party libraries include static calls to external APIs that
cannot be called dynamically. Rather than mocking these calls, test
wrappers SHOULD be used in such cases.

A test wrapper is a class that exists solely as a decorator for calling
non-class functions or static methods. A test wrapper MUST NOT contain
any logic. A test wrapper SHOULD be injected via a constructor. Test
wrappers SHOULD reside in their own namespaces. One test wrapper MAY
be used for wrapping more than one call, if calls are of similar nature.

## Setup method in xUnit

A class under test SHOULD be initialized only once per unit test in its
setup method and saved into a test class property. If the class under
test has any constructor dependencies that need to be mocked, all calls
to mocking methods SHOULD be done immediately before class
initialization in the setup method. If there is any other code in
the setup method, it SHOULD be executed before class initialization.

## Separation of mocks

All mocking methods SHOULD be separated from the main test code into
separate methods and/or classes. If mock-related methods are contained
in the same class as tests, they SHOULD be located below setup, teardown
and tests per se.

## Using callbacks for mocked methods

Callbacks SHOULD be used for mocked methods whenever there is a shadow
of doubt over the possibility of changing expected return value or
arguments at runtime.

For example, this code
```
$mock->shouldReceive('foo')->andReturn($this->returnValue);
```
SHOULD need to be rewritten as follows:
```
$mock->shouldReceive('foo')->andReturnUsing(function () {
    return $this->returnValue;
});
```

The mock callback methods MAY either be lambdas or use the `Callback`
suffix.
