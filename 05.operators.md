Operators
=========

Some operators and keywords, although present in many programming
languages, are unnecessary and SHOULD NOT be used.

## ELSE operator

An `else` operator signals that the method is too long and should be
divided into smaller methods. All `else` operators SHOULD be swapped for
`return` operators. The only place where an `else` operator is
appropriate is template code where it is impossible to return early.

## ELSEIF / ELSE IF / ELSIF / ELIF operator

An `elseif` operator is undesirable for the same reason as `else`
operator. Sequences of `elseif`'s SHOULD be replaced by `switch`'s
wherever appropriate. There is a single case where `elseif` MAY be used
outside of template code - in factories, together with `instanceof`
operator, as it is impossible to use `switch` in this case:
```
if ($foo instanceof Bar) {
} elseif ($foo instanceof Baz) {
}
```

## SWITCH, CASE and DEFAULT operators

`switch/case` operators are just `elseif`'s with better syntax. They
SHOULD be used in factories and templates and SHOULD NOT be used
anywhere else. `return` rather than `break` SHOULD be used inside `case`
body, therefore `default` operator SHOULD NOT ever be used outside
templates.

## Ternary operator

Ternary operator is nothing more than `else` in disguise, besides, it
usually violates "one statement per line" principle. Ternary operators
SHOULD NOT be used outside of templates.

## CONTINUE and BREAK operators

Both `continue` and `break` operators inside cycles are signals for
methods that are too long, therefore they SHOULD NOT be used, use
`return` instead.

## WHILE and DO WHILE operators

Both of these are dangerous because they can lead to infinite cycles,
therefore they SHOULD NOT be used, use `foreach` and `for` instead.

## INSTANCEOF operator

Outside of factories, using `instanceof` means that a polymorphic
hierarchy is missing. `instanceof` SHOULD NOT be used outside of
factories, and if there is no simple way to get rid of it, then
refactoring is due.
